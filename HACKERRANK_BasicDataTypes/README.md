In this folder there are all the exercises of the [Basic data types](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=py-basic-data-types) challenge.
For the 'Find the runner up score' and 'Nested list' challenges, I've checked the Discussion section in order to complete the exercises.
